# avwie/kotlinx

This repository contains libraries, starters and simple example code for my personal projects.

## Version catalog

All the versioning is done via the version catalog that is part of `/gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Plugins

The plugins folder contains pre-compiled script plugins for:

- libraries
- starters

## Libraries

Libraries are part of the `libraries` subfolder and are published to a private Jetbrains Space repository.

## Demos

These contain small samples I want to create but don't warrant a full new project.
